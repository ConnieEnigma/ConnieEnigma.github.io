Here are some highlights from my publications.

### Programmable Pulse Generator for Pain Relief Stimulation using Bioresorbable Electrodes

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a wearable Pulse Generator (PG) device designed for analgesic nerve stimulation using a custom Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). The PG is capable of measuring the impedance of the injected electrode and adjusting the current pulse accordingly. This feedback mechanism significantly slows the degradation of the electrode, extending its life from 30 hours to over 80 hours in a vitro study. The system was implemented using TSMC 180nm technology and has a peak power consumption of 26.4mW.
- **Key Contributions**:
    - Designed a current-steering DAC for precise current pulse generation (±4mA with ≤1% linearity mismatch).
    - Developed a digital control system with an FSM for SPI communication and pulse configuration.
    - Verified the design with a custom PCB and demonstrated a significant extension of electrode lifetime.
